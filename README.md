# Test pyramid

The purpose of this project is to demo the automation tools for the comprehensive web application testing

## Web application under test

In the project directory we use a react login application. you can run:

### Start Web application

```shell
npm start
```

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### Build Web application

```shell
npm run build
```

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

## Component testing

### Storybook test

Storybook provides a clean-room environment for testing components in isolation. Stories make it easy to explore a component in all its variations, no matter how complex.

### Cypress component testing

Cypress Component Testing provides a component workbench for you to quickly build and test components from multiple front-end UI libraries â€” no matter how simple or complex.

### Storybook visual

Visual tests, also called visual regression tests, catch bugs in UI appearance. As more teams use isolated components to build their UIs, it's becoming more valuable to utilize visual testing to maintain components and component libraries.
